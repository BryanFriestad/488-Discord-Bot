# 488-Discord-Bot
A discord bot that is used to reserve computer/FPGA boards for my CprE 488 embedded systems lab

In order for this to work, you will need a special .env file that looks something like this

\# .env  
DISCORD_TOKEN="<your_bot_token>"  
DISCORD_GUILD="<server_name>"  
BRYAN_ID="<your_discord_id>"
